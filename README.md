Heroku buildpack: postgresql
=========================

This is a [Heroku buildpack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) that
allows one to vendor in a postgresql binary to a Heroku application.
It is meant to be used in conjunction with other buildpacks as part of a
[multi-buildpack](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi).
